# CUED Part IA Flood Warning System

This is the Part IA Lent Term computing activity at the Department of
Engineering, University of Cambridge.

The activity is documented at
https://cued-partia-flood-warning.readthedocs.io/.

I worked on this with my lab partner where we wrote code in Python to pull live data from the Met Office to determine which areas of the UK were most at least of flooding. We also devised unit tests for each function that we wrote.
